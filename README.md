HS.DataStructures provides useful data structures for .NET code.

Classes include:

LruCache A least-recently-used cache, using interface ICache.

CircularBuffer It is what its name suggests. Has a companion, CircularBufferEnumerator.

Set This was useful before HashSet existed and is perhaps still useful for code running on older versions of the framework. Uses interface ISet
